# Capstone-Project-_Predicting-Binary-outcome
This research project is dedicated to developing models capable of predicting binary outcomes from complex genomic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets. Utilizing simulated data, the project aims to explore the predictive power of specific genetic markers on binary health outcomes, delineating between control and case subjects
# Pacakges Required
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.9.13
- anaconda 2022.10
- Required Libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- skrebate

# Setup instructions:
Jupyter Notebook: If Jupyter Notebook is not installed, it can be installed as part of the Anaconda distribution available.
Python: Python can be downloaded and installed from the online platform
Dependencies: Install the necessary libraries by executing the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
 - pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn skrebate

  # How to Execute the Code:
- After installing all required libraries, packages, and fulfilling software prerequisites, follow the steps below:
- Clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal, command prompt, or Anaconda prompt, navigate to the desired directory for cloning, and execute the following command: "git clone https://github.com/Chaudhari03/Capstone-Project-_Predicting-Binary-outcome.git
- Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the project directory: cd Capstone-Project-_Predicting-Binary-outcome (Navigate to the folder saved from GitHub).
- Initiate Jupyter Notebook by executing the following command: jupyter notebook
- Open the Notebook: Within the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the location where the repository was cloned, locate the notebook file (usually ending with .ipynb), and click on the "Predicting a binary outcome in simulated data" file to open it.
- Make sure the dataset is in the same folder as the .ipynb file
- With the notebook opened, execute all cells by clicking on "Kernel" in the menu bar and selecting "Restart & Run All"
- As the execution is happening, observe the output displayed below each cell, which may include generated plots, tables, or other visualizations as a result of the executed code.
