# Capstone-Project-_Predicting-Binary-outcome
This research project is dedicated to developing models capable of predicting binary outcomes from complex genomic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets. Utilizing simulated data, the project aims to explore the predictive power of specific genetic markers on binary health outcomes, delineating between control and case subjects
